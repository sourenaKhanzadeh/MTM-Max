## Description
This is our design for the bonus portion of our CPS510 database assignment.

The name of the application is MTM-Max. It is a streaming service that allows users to purchase a monthly membership to stream media in the forms of music, television, and movies. There are three membership subscription options with different benefits: premium, standard, basic. Premium allows the user unlimited streaming for all forms of media. Standard allows the user 20 movies, 10 TV series, and unlimited music. Basic allows the user 5 movies, 2 tv-series, and  20 music. All users also have the option to purchase any media.

Admin privileges on the app, are such that admin users can manage the content on the app by adding, removing, and altering content. As well as overseeing the client users.

As far as functionality goes we have submitted a document with descriptive screenshots that demonstrate the app well.
